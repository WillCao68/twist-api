# Action buttons

Action buttons are used inside other objects
like [threads](#threads), [comments](#comments)
or [messages](#conversation-messages). As it's possible to have many
action buttons inside the same object, they are represented as a list
of action buttons in the `actions` key.

They are used to make it easy to execute an action for the message
received. An example of usage would be adding text to the message box or a
link to another page.

> Action buttons objects:

```json
{
    ...,

    "actions": [
        {
            "action": "open_url",
            "url": "https://www.google.com",
            "type": "action",
            "button_text": "Open Url Action Btn"
        },
        {
            "action": "prefill_message",
            "message": "This message is prefilled by an action button",
            "type": "action",
            "button_text": "Prefill Message Action Btn"
        },
        {
            "action": "send_reply",
            "message": "This reply was sent by an action button",
            "type": "action",
            "button_text": "Send Reply Action Btn"
        },
    ],

    ...
