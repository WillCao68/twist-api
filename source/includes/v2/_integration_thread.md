# &#8627; Thread

Thread integrations are installed on a thread level, and they can post new
comments.

It provides an URL for distribution and installation, so the
integration developer can provide it to his users. The installation
page asks for write permission to one channel or thread and which
teams it should notify.

**Example usage**: Post comments when new issues are added to a Github
repository.


## Incoming webhook

Sometimes a developer just want **an incoming webhook** URL to post via
some script or external system without setting up a webserver and so
on. It can be done via [OAuth integration](#oauth) by using the token
provided or via channel or thread integration.

To do that using a thread integration, you just have to create and
install it. After the installation, Twist will provide the URL for
manual posting.

Please follow the subsection on
[How to post data from a thread integration](#how-to-post-data-from-a-thread-integration).


## Outgoing webhook

**Note**: Outgoing webhook for threads is really different from [the
one provided by OAuth](#outgoing-webhook). ðŸ˜‰

Outgoing webhooks send data when an activity happens (e.g. a new
comment is added to the thread or an uninstall happens).

It sends an HTTPS POST request to your specified URL and your webhook
handler can respond to add data back to Twist. The payload depends on
the integration type.

The outgoing hooks can work with any language or framework â€” as long as they
support HTTPS and JSON.
