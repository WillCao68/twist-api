# Introduction

This is the official Twist API documentation, a reference to the functionality
our public API provides, with detailed description of each API endpoint, its
parameters, and examples.


## Authentication

Login and signup are done via [/api/v2/users/login](#login)
and [/api/v2/users/register](#register). For public integration, you must
use our [OAuth 2 authentication](#oauth).

If you just want a token to try the API, we provide a test token when you create
an application following what we describe in
the [OAuth 2 authentication](#oauth) guide.


## Temporary ids

Temporary ids are negative and can be used when adding, updating or deleting
items.


## Request, response, and error handling

The maximum allowed size of the request body for common requests is 5MB. Some
attachments have their own limits for upload, please check their own sections
for more details.

A response is always a JSON object which can be the following:

- On successful return: JSON data.
- On an error return, HTTP error code followed by: `{“error”: [error_code, error_string], **kwargs}`.


## Dates

For dates we use [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601). The
formatting we can have inside the system:

- Date time: `%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S`.
- Date only: `%Y-%m-%d`.
- With timezone info: `%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S +00:00`.

The current API should only return `%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S`, where the time zone is
implicit set to `UTC`.
